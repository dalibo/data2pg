# This file belongs to data2pg, the framework that helps migrating data to PostgreSQL databases from various sources
# It is a parameter file for the data2pg.pl scheduler

# Identifier of the target database to migrate (mandatory)
TARGET_DATABASE    = my_pg_db               # case sensitive, must match the target_database table content in the data2pg database

# Identifier of the batch (mandatory)
BATCH_NAME         = MY_BATCH               # case sensitive, must match the data2pg schema content in the target database

# The maximum number of opened sessions on the target database. This defines the parallelism degree for the run.
#MAX_SESSIONS       = 1                      # Default = 1

# Among the opened sessions, number of sessions for which the steps will be assigned in estimated cost ascending order.
#ASC_SESSIONS       = 0                      # Default = 0

# Comment for the run
#COMMENT            = My comment             # No default

# Step options, in JSON format. They are forwarded to each elementary step of the batch to adjust their behaviour.
#STEP_OPTIONS = {"COPY_MAX_ROWS":1000}       # Default is no step option
#                                            # Available options are: COPY_MAX_ROWS to limit the number of copied rows per table or table part.
